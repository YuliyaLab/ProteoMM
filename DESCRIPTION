Package: ProteoMM
Title: Multi-Dataset Model-based Differential Expression Proteomics Analysis Platform
Version: 0.99.6
Description: ProteoMM is a statistical method to perform model-based 
             peptide-level differential expression analysis of single or 
             multiple datasets. For multiple datasets ProteoMM produces a 
             single fold change and p-value for each protein across multiple 
             datasets. 
             ProteoMM provides functionality for normalization, missing 
             value imputation and differential expression. 
             Model-based peptide-level imputation and differential expression 
             analysis component of package follows the analysis described in  
             “A statistical framework for protein quantitation in bottom-up 
             MS based proteomics" (Karpievitch et al. Bioinformatics 2009).  
	         EigenMS normalisation is implemented as described in 
	         "Normalization of peak intensities in bottom-up MS-based proteomics 
	         using singular value  decomposition." 
	         (Karpievitch et al. Bioinformatics 2009).
