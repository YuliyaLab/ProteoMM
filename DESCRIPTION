Description: ProteoMM is a statistical method to perform model-based peptide-level 
             differential expression analysis of single or multiple datasets. For multiple 
	     datasets ProteoMM produces a single fold change and p-value for each protein 
             across multiple datasets. 
             ProteoMM provides functionality for normalization, missing value imputation 
             and differential expression. 
             Model-based peptide-level imputation and differential expression analysis 		     component of package follows the analysis described in  â€œA statistical 
             framework for protein quantitation in bottom-up MS based proteomics" 
             (Karpievitch et al. Bioinformatics 2009).  
	     EigenMS normalisation is implemented as described in "Normalization of peak 
	     intensities in bottom-up MS-based proteomics using singular value 
             decomposition." (Karpievitch et al. Bioinformatics 2009).
